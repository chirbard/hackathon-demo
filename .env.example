# Distributed Deployment Configuration

This file contains environment variables for the distributed deployment setup.

## For the Server/Admin Machine (.env file)
Create a `.env` file in the project root with:

```bash
# Docker Compose project name
COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=hackathon-demo-server
```

## For the Presenter Client Machine (.env file)
Create a `.env` file in the project root with:

```bash
# IP address of the machine running the server
# Replace this with the actual IP address of your server machine
SERVER_HOST=192.168.1.100

# Docker Compose project name
COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=hackathon-demo-presenter
```

## Finding Your Server Machine's IP Address

On the server machine, run one of these commands to find the IP address:

### macOS/Linux:
```bash
# Get all network interfaces
ip addr show

# Or on macOS:
ifconfig

# Or get just the main IP:
hostname -I
```

### Windows:
```cmd
ipconfig
```

Look for the IP address on your local network (usually starts with 192.168.x.x or 10.x.x.x).
